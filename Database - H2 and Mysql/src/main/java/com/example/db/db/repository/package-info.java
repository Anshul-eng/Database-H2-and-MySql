 *    Disadvantages of using old way
 *    - more prone to error
 *    - in terms of maintainence
 *    - conversionn of java object to resultset
 *
 *    aws instance = 12000 conncurrent connections
 *
 *    - per application instance (100 connections)
 *    (3 such applications)
 *    atleast (300 connections would be active , but cached in connectionpool)
 *    there are consumers / applications reading from our database - consumers alson involve using connections
